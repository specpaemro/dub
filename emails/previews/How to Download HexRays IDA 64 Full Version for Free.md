Fortunately, there is a way to download Hex-Rays IDA 6.4 Full Version for free. Hex-Rays offers a free binary code analysis tool called IDA Free, which is a limited version of IDA that can still analyze both 32-bit and 64-bit applications, use a cloud-based decompiler, save your analysis results, and more.
 
To download IDA Free, you need to visit the Hex-Rays website[^1^] and choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, Linux, or Mac). The download size is about 70-90 MB depending on the platform. You will also need to agree to the terms and conditions of use, which state that you cannot use IDA Free for commercial purposes, among other limitations.
 
Once you have downloaded IDA Free, you can install it on your computer and start using it to analyze binary code samples. You can also access the documentation, tutorials, sample plugins, user contributions, and plugin contest pages on the Hex-Rays website[^1^] to learn more about how to use IDA effectively.
 
However, if you want to enjoy all the features and benefits of IDA Pro, such as support for more processors, file formats, debuggers, decompilers, Python scripting, headless analysis, text UI, C++ SDK, Lumina server, technical support, and more, you will need to purchase a license from Hex-Rays[^2^]. The price varies depending on the bundle and options you choose.
 
In conclusion, Hex-Rays IDA 6.4 Full Version is a powerful tool for binary code analysis and reverse engineering, but it is not free. You can download a limited version called IDA Free from the Hex-Rays website[^1^], but you will miss out on many features and benefits that IDA Pro offers. If you want to get the most out of IDA, you will need to buy a license from Hex-Rays[^2^].
  
If you are wondering why you would need to use IDA in the first place, here are some of the reasons why IDA is a useful tool for binary code analysis and reverse engineering:
 
- IDA can help you understand how an application works, what algorithms it uses, what vulnerabilities it has, and how to exploit them.
- IDA can help you modify an application's behavior, patch bugs, remove malware, bypass protections, and create cheats.
- IDA can help you recover source code from compiled binaries, or at least generate pseudocode that is easier to read and modify.
- IDA can help you learn new programming languages, architectures, and techniques by studying real-world examples of binary code.

Of course, using IDA also requires some skills and knowledge, such as assembly language, debugging, decompiling, reverse engineering methods, and more. You will also need to follow the ethical and legal guidelines of using IDA and respect the intellectual property rights of the software authors.
 
In summary, IDA is a powerful and versatile tool for binary code analysis and reverse engineering that can help you achieve many goals and tasks. However, it is not free and you will need to purchase a license from Hex-Rays to use the full version of IDA. Alternatively, you can download a limited version called IDA Free from the Hex-Rays website, but you will have to deal with some restrictions and limitations.
